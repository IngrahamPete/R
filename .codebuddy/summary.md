# Project Summary

## Overview of Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
The project is primarily developed using Kotlin, as indicated by the presence of `.kts` files, which are Kotlin script files. It utilizes Gradle as the build automation tool, which is evident from the `build.gradle.kts` and `settings.gradle.kts` files. The project may also rely on various libraries that can be specified in the `build.gradle.kts` file, although specific libraries are not listed in the provided file structure.

## Purpose of the Project
While the specific purpose of the project is not detailed in the provided information, it can be inferred that it is a Kotlin-based application or library that employs Gradle for build management. The use of Kotlin suggests a focus on modern, type-safe programming practices.
